# IntraNeft (in progress)

This is a space for my Capstone Project, which will be a fullstack Ecommerce Application.

# Project Proposal

The latest technical innovations allow transactions to be easier than ever before. Shopping used to be a full-day process of commuting, shopping lists, counting out cash, counting out change, transporting goods back home, and more. Modern E-Commerce has slimmed this whole process down into less than a minute-long experience for the customer and transformed our economic world. We thought it couldn’t get any easier from there. But it did. Now currency is more than just green paper, it is an integer that lives on the internet. Crypto currencies have not only made ecommerce easier than ever, but it has also been a breakthrough in security and encryption that has never been seen before. Crypto wallets started turning into more than just an easy way to perform transactions, but art galleries. Displays of interesting coin collections. Non-Fungible Tokens were born from this intrigue of turning certain crypto tokens into on-of-a-kind. Collectables that grew in value the more views it got. Now artists everywhere are watching our world bloom with opportunity to grow. Non-Fungible Tokens are turning into more than just a jpeg, but photography, music, video, podcasts. Great at has never been more abundant on the internet. Wallets are transforming from a handful of crumpled green bills to galleries of art. What a beautiful excuse to support talented artists all over the world!

Being captured by the brilliance of this new economic idea, I have decided to make an e-commerce app. This app will be a place where artists can upload their collections of art, and collectors can purchase it to add to their digital wallets. It will not only be a space for artists to be creative, but for investors to make profits, collectors to add to their galleries, and for regular people like you and me to update our portfolios, and even just admire artists’ work. 

I will do this with the help of a couple different technologies. Node.js will be the framework I will use for the server on the backend, Mongo DB will be the database platform I use, and I will create a simple but elegant frontend using bootstrap’s framework and the adobe InDesign platform. 

My professional goal with this project is to solidify my skills as a full-stack developer. I want to work one day on both the front and back end of applications. This project will challenge both skills and show employers that I know how to use the mentioned technologies. I also hope that it will be a great display of great UX design as well as software design for employers to view. 

My goal is to have the server side completed after two weeks, the database design completed the following weeks, and the frontend completed the following two weeks after that. After those six weeks of coding, the next 6 weeks will be set aside for bug fixes, code improvement, and improving SEO metrics. 
Overall, I believe this project will not only aid my growth as a fullstack developer but allow me to explore a world of technology that excites me to enter the development workforce.
